# Review code on demand

Run quality review agents. Review manually written code, assess existing codebases, or check a branch before merging.

## Review Scope

<review_scope>$ARGUMENTS</review_scope>

## Step 1 — Detect Scope

Parse the review scope above for optional file paths or directories.

**If paths are provided:**

1. Validate each path exists (split on whitespace, check each token)
2. Use provided paths as review scope
3. Announce scope to user and proceed to Step 2

**If no paths provided:**

Run the scope detection script:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-review-scope.sh
```

- **If `SCOPE=branch`**: use the listed files as review scope. Announce scope summary: number of changed files, which areas of the codebase are affected. Proceed to Step 2.
- **If `SCOPE=default`**: tell the user: "You're on `<CURRENT_BRANCH>`. No branch diff available." Use **AskUserQuestion**: "What would you like to review?" with options:
  - **Specify files or directories**: accept paths from the user
  - **Review entire project**: no scope constraint

## Step 2 — Run Reviews

Run `pwd` and let `<PWD>` be the result — subagents may change directories, making relative paths unreliable. The report directory is `<PWD>/docs/code-review/`.

Run the **default review agents** listed below **in parallel**. Projects may define additional review agents in their `CLAUDE.md` — if any are specified, include them alongside the defaults. Projects may also replace the default set entirely by specifying their own list.

Each agent prompt must include:

1. The scope constraint — one of:
   - A list of changed files (for branch diff scope)
   - An instruction to limit review to specific paths (for path scope)
   - No constraint (for full project review)

2. The report output instructions (substitute `<PWD>` with the absolute path resolved above):

   > Write your full detailed report to `<PWD>/docs/code-review/<name>.md` (create the directory if needed). This is an absolute path — use it exactly as given, do not convert to relative.
   > Then return ONLY a short structured summary to the parent context in this format:
   >
   > ```markdown
   > ## <Agent Name> Summary
   > **Report**: `<PWD>/docs/code-review/<name>.md` (<word_count> words)
   > **Critical**: <count> | **Important**: <count> | **Suggestions**: <count>
   > ### Findings
   > - [Critical] <one-line description>
   > - [Important] <one-line description>
   > - [Suggestion] <one-line description>
   > ```
   >
   > Do NOT return the full report text. Only return the summary above.

Default agents and their report filenames (substitute `<PWD>` with the absolute path resolved above):

| Agent | Report file |
|-------|------------|
| **@vgv-review-agent** | `<PWD>/docs/code-review/vgv-review.md` |
| **@code-simplicity-review-agent** | `<PWD>/docs/code-review/code-simplicity-review.md` |
| **@test-quality-review-agent** | `<PWD>/docs/code-review/test-quality-review.md` |
| **@architecture-review-agent** | `<PWD>/docs/code-review/architecture-review.md` |

**If an agent fails:** Note the failure, continue with successful agents. After all agents complete, report which (if any) failed and offer to retry.

## Step 3 — Consolidate & Present

After all reviews complete:

1. [Categorize findings](references/review-consolidation.md) from all summaries into Critical, Important, and Suggestions.

2. **Present the consolidated summary** to the user with counts per category and the one-line descriptions from each agent.

3. **If no findings:** Code looks good. Reports are at `docs/code-review/`.

## Step 4 — Act

Use **AskUserQuestion** to present post-review options:

- **Auto-fix critical issues**: Read the specific report files for full details on each critical finding. Fix them, then run the project's linter and test runner for validation. One attempt per fix — if validation fails, present the issue to the user with context on what failed and what was tried, and move on. Only modify files within the original review scope.
- **Fix all issues (critical + important)**: Same as above but also address important findings. Read relevant report files for details. Only modify files within the original review scope.
- **Review the list**: Show the full list of findings with report file paths so the user can decide what to address manually.
- **Keep reports and exit**: Reports remain at `docs/code-review/` for manual review. Done.

**After fixing (if chosen):**

1. Run project linter and test runner for validation (no agent re-run)
2. Present a brief summary of what was fixed

## Gotchas

- If `docs/code-review/` already exists from a previous review, old reports will be overwritten by agents with the same name. Delete the directory first if you want a clean slate.
- On the default branch with no diff, the review scope is ambiguous. The skill asks the user to specify — do not default to reviewing the entire project without confirmation.
- Agent failures are non-fatal. If one agent fails, the others still produce reports. Always report which agents failed so the user knows the review is incomplete.
- Auto-fix only modifies files within the original review scope. If a fix requires changes outside scope (e.g., updating a shared import), flag it to the user instead of silently expanding scope.

## Important

- Reports are kept at `docs/code-review/` as untracked working files. Commit or delete them when no longer needed.
- This skill is advisory. It presents findings and lets you decide what to act on.
- When in doubt about a finding, read the full report file for details before deciding.
